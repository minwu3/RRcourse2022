# ASSIGNMENT 2 (for 30/31.03.2022)

Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia.
E.g. [Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes) (see table just above the References)

Then create a short report (you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task) that contains, for example:

(do a commit after each step!)

## 1. A brief description of the show (use _italics_ for names).  
# _Friends_  
Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. 


## 2. A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.  
<table class="infobox vevent"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" class="infobox-above summary" style="background: #CCCCFF; padding: 0.25em 1em; font-size: 125%;"><i>Friends</i></th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="infobox-image"><a href="/wiki/File:Friends_logo.svg" class="image"><img alt="Friends logo.svg" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Friends_logo.svg/250px-Friends_logo.svg.png" decoding="async" width="250" height="41" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Friends_logo.svg/375px-Friends_logo.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Friends_logo.svg/500px-Friends_logo.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="1186" data-file-height="196"></a></td></tr> </table>
## 3. A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).  
friends_info.csv
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
friends = pd.read_csv("/Users/jeank4723/Desktop/RR/friends_episodes_v3.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")
season_stars = friends.groupby('Season').mean().Stars.to_frame().reset_index()
season_stars.columns = ['Season','Average Stars']
season_stars = season_stars.sort_values('Season', ascending=True)
season_stars
```


## 4. A graph of the viewership over time.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggpubr)
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
friends <- read.csv('/Users/jeank4723/Desktop/RR/friends_episodes_v3.csv')
head(friends)

friends_year <- friends  %>%
  group_by(Year_of_prod) %>%
  summarise(Episode.Number,Votes=sum(Votes),Season, Year_of_prod)

Votes_plot_year <- ggplot(data = friends_year, aes(x = Year_of_prod, y = Votes, color = factor(Season)))   

Votes_plot_year + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1994, 2004),
                     breaks = seq(1994, 2004)) +
  labs(title = "Episode Votes For Year", x = "Year", y = "Votes") 


```


## 5. A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.

```{r}
friends <- read.csv('/Users/jeank4723/Desktop/RR/friends_episodes_v3.csv')

friends_season_1 <- friends  %>%
  filter(Season < 6) %>%
  summarise(Episode.Number,Votes,Season)

friends_season_2 <- friends  %>%
  filter(Season > 5) %>%
  summarise(Episode.Number,Votes,Season)


Votes_plot_1 <- ggplot(data = friends_season_1, aes(x = Episode.Number, y = Votes, color = factor(Season)))   
Votes_plot_2 <- ggplot(data = friends_season_2, aes(x = Episode.Number, y = Votes, color = factor(Season)))  

Votes_plot_1 + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()  +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10),
                     breaks = seq(1,10)) +
  labs(title = "Episode Votes For Season 1 to 5", x = "Episode Number", y = "Votes") 

Votes_plot_2 + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10),
                     breaks = seq(1,10)) +
  labs(title = "Episode Votes For Season 6 to 10", x = "Episode Number", y = "Votes") 


```


## 6. A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by `insert_calculated_number` between seasons 3 and 5).

The last episode in Season `10` have the highest votes. 

## 7. Make sure your report looks nice -> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.


## 8. `knitr` your report and save it in the relevant folder (RR_Mar_30_31) of your repo. 

`knitr` the report

## 9. Commit the changes and push them to Github.
